# PROJECT PORTFOLIO
## A quick collection of most of the things I have done either on the side for my own fun, or with permission from previous employers.

__PLEASE NOTE:__ You will perhaps realize that a small amount of this code is copy-pasted from other sources. This is because it was exploratory in nature, and if needed I will ammend in in the future to personalize it. No copyright infrigement was intended.

__ALSO:__ You will see some solutions to LeetCode questions. These are my original submissions, and any accidental similarities between what I wrote and what you may have seen elsewhere is *NOT INTENDED*. Pardon in advance.

Most of this stuff is in Python, though some in MATLAB. I try to make it as varied as possible. If you have new ideas or suggestions, please let me know!
